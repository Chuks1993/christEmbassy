							</header>
							<p>Believers' LoveWorld Incorporated, (a.k.a Christ Embassy) is a global ministry with a vision of taking God's divine presence
							to the nations of the world and to demonstrate the character of the Holy Spirit. This is achieved through every available
							means, as the Ministry is driven by a passion to see men and women all over the world, come to the knowledge of the divine
							life made available in Christ Jesus.</p>

							<p>Through the years, various arms of the Ministry have been birthed to effectively proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

							<p>The Ministry has a vibrant TV Ministry, Internet Ministry, the Healing School, Rhapsody of Realities, and an Inner-city mission;
							where children without hope of a future are fed, housed, clothed, educated and given a chance to live out their dreams. The
							Ministry also hosts various crusades in the largest arenas in various countries where millions have been brought into the
							kingdom of God, and mighty miraculous works have been demonstrated. The venues of such meetings are constantly filled to
							capacity.</p>

							<p>This global mission has led to the establishment of an ever-widening network of hundreds of churches and fellowships worldwide
							in all continents, affecting millions of people with a unique and timely revelation of the new creation in Christ Jesus.</p>

							<p>The Ministry will stop at nothing in ensuring that the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is preached in all the nations of
							the world as is expected by the Lord.</p>
